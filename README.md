# startup
This repository is for CS260, for the beginnings of a startup project.

GitHub Assignment, due 1/25.
So far, this repository is entirely practice for using GitHub.  For this assignment, I learned how to better merge conflicts in VS Code. I feel like I have a better understanding of how my IDE interacts with GitHub.
