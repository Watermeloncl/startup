# startup
This repository is for CS260, for the beginnings of a startup project.

GitHub Assignment, due 1/25.
So far, this repository is entirely practice for using GitHub. Personally, I hate GitHub. It has it's uses, but it tends to be incredibly annoying, easily messed up, and quite confusing. Nonetheless, it's required, so here we are. For this assignment, I learned how to better merge conflicts in VS Code.
